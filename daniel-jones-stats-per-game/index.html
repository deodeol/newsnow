If you're a fan of the New York Giants or simply interested in football statistics, you've come to the right place. In this article, we'll dive into the details of Daniel Jones' performance on the field and analyze his stats per game. Whether you're looking for a breakdown of his passing yards, touchdowns, or interceptions, we've got you covered. </p><p> So, what exactly are Daniel Jones' stats per game? Let's start with the basics. Daniel Jones is the starting quarterback for the New York Giants, a position he has held since 2019. In his rookie season, Jones showed promise and potential, throwing for over 3,000 yards and 24 touchdowns. However, he also struggled with turnovers, throwing 12 interceptions and fumbling the ball 18 times. In his second season, Jones' performance was more inconsistent, with a higher number of interceptions and a lower completion percentage. </p><p> In summary, Daniel Jones' stats per game show a mixed bag of results. While he has shown flashes of brilliance, especially in his rookie season, he has also struggled with turnovers and accuracy. The Giants' coaching staff and fans alike are hoping to see improvement from Jones in the upcoming season, as he continues to develop as a quarterback. </p><h2> Daniel Jones Stats Per Game: A Closer Look </h2><p> Let's take a closer look at Daniel Jones' stats per game to understand his performance on a deeper level.
