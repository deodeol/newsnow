These symptoms may be signs of a serious condition called chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). CTEPH is a rare form of pulmonary hypertension that can often go undiagnosed, leading to worsened symptoms and decreased quality of life. It is important to understand the symptoms of CTEPH and seek medical attention if you suspect you may be affected.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCTEPH symptoms can vary from person to person, but they typically include shortness of breath, especially during physical activity or exertion. Fatigue and weakness are also common symptoms, as the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed blood vessels in the lungs. Chest pain or discomfort may be present, along with a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Some individuals may also experience swelling in the ankles, legs, or abdomen.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional. CTEPH can be a life-threatening condition if left untreated, so early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Your doctor will likely perform a series of tests to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out other potential conditions. These may include imaging tests such as a CT scan or pulmonary angiography, as well as lung function tests.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn summary, CTEPH symptoms can include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, and swelling.

The shortness of breath and fatigue are caused by the narrowed blood vessels in the lungs, which restrict the flow of oxygenated blood. This puts additional strain on the heart, leading to symptoms such as chest pain and an irregular heartbeat. The swelling in the extremities is a result of fluid retention due to the heart\u0027s decreased ability to pump blood effectively.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is CTEPH?\u003c\/h2\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCTEPH, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, is a rare condition characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. It is caused by chronic blood clots that remain in the lung blood vessels, leading to narrowing and obstruction. This condition can develop after a person has had one or multiple episodes of acute pulmonary embolism, where blood clots block the arteries in the lungs. Over time, these clots can become organized and fibrotic, causing permanent damage to the lung tissue and leading to CTEPH.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe History and Myth of CTEPH Symptoms\u003c\/h2\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCTEPH was first described as a distinct clinical entity in the 1950s, but it remained poorly understood and often misdiagnosed for many years.

Chest pain: Experiencing chest discomfort or pain, especially during physical activity, should not be ignored. 4. Rapid or irregular heartbeat: Pay attention to any changes in your heart rate, as this could be a symptom of CTEPH. 5. Swelling: If you notice swelling in your ankles, legs, or abdomen, it may be a sign of CTEPH and should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2\u003eQuestion and Answer\u003c\/h2\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQ: Can CTEPH be cured?
