Read the Manual</h4><p> Before using your PRO25S, take the time to read the manual thoroughly. Familiarize yourself with its features and functions to ensure proper usage and maximize its capabilities. </p><h4>2. Regular Maintenance</h4><p> Make it a habit to regularly charge and maintain your batteries with the PRO25S, even if they are not in use. This will help extend their lifespan and prevent unexpected failures when you need them the most. </p><h4>3. Store in a Cool and Dry Place</h4><p> When not in use, store your PRO25S in a cool and dry place to prevent damage from extreme temperatures or moisture. This will help prolong its lifespan and ensure reliable performance. </p><h4>4. Follow Safety Precautions</h4><p> Always follow the safety precautions outlined in the manual when using your PRO25S. This includes wearing protective gear, keeping the charger away from flammable materials, and avoiding contact with electrical components. </p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><h4>Q: Can the CTEK PRO25S charge multiple batteries at once?</h4><p> A: Yes, the PRO25S is capable of charging multiple batteries simultaneously using its unique parallel charging feature. This allows you to save time and charge multiple batteries at once. </p><h4>Q: Is the CTEK PRO25S compatible with lithium-ion batteries?</h4><p> A: No, the PRO25S is specifically designed for 12V lead-acid batteries and is not compatible with lithium-ion batteries.
