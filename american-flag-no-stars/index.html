It is often used as a symbol of protest, to express dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs in our country. It can be seen as a statement against government policies or actions, and a call for change. </p><p> The American flag with no stars is a powerful symbol that represents the desire for a better America. It is a way for individuals to express their discontent and frustration, while still maintaining their love and loyalty to their country.
