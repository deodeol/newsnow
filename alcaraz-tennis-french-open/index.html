Adapt your footwork: The slower pace and higher bounce of the ball on clay require players to adjust their footwork. Focus on staying light on your feet and be prepared to move laterally. 2. Use topspin: Clay courts favor players who can generate topspin. This helps the ball to clear the net and land deep in the court, making it more difficult for your opponent to attack. 3. Stay patient: Clay court matches tend to be longer and more physically demanding. It is important to stay patient and not rush your shots. Look for opportunities to construct points and wait for the right moment to go for a winner. 4. Practice sliding: Sliding on clay courts is an essential skill.
