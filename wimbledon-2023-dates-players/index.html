It has been held annually since 1877 and takes place at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London. The tournament is played on grass courts, which adds a unique element to the game and requires players to adjust their playing style. </p><p> Wimbledon is known for its traditions, such as the strict dress code for players, including all-white attire, and the consumption of strawberries and cream by spectators. The tournament also has a royal connection, with the winner of the men's singles event receiving a trophy from the Duke of Kent. </p><p> The tournament is divided into five main events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each event features top-ranked players from around the world, competing for the championship title. The matches are played in a best-of-five sets format, with tiebreakers used to determine the winner in case of a tie. </p><h2>History and Myth of Wimbledon</h2><p> Wimbledon has a rich history that dates back over a century.
