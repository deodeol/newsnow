Livingston was appointed to draft a formal statement declaring the colonies' independence from Britain.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, drew inspiration from Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The document reflects the ideals of individual rights, government by consent, and the right to revolution if the government fails to protect those rights.</p><p>Over the years, the signing of the Declaration of Independence has become a legendary event in American history. The popular image of the Founding Fathers gathering together in Philadelphia to sign the document is iconic. However, the reality is that the Declaration of Independence was not signed by all the delegates on July 4, 1776. The signing process took several months, and the last signature was not added until November 1776.</p><h2>Hidden Secrets of Declaration of Independence Text Printable</h2><p>While there may not be any hidden secrets in the text of the Declaration of Independence itself, there are some interesting facts and details that are worth noting.
