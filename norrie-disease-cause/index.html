It is caused by a mutation in the NDP gene, which is responsible for producing a protein called norrin. This protein plays a critical role in the development and function of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Without norrin, the retina does not develop properly and vision is impaired. The cause of Norrie disease is primarily genetic, as it is passed down from parent to child. It is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that the gene mutation is located on the X chromosome. Because males have only one X chromosome, a mutation in the NDP gene can have a significant impact on their vision. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they are typically carriers of the gene mutation but do not experience the same degree of vision loss as males. In summary, Norrie disease is caused by a mutation in the NDP gene, which leads to a deficiency of the norrin protein. This deficiency affects the development and function of the retina, resulting in vision loss. The disorder is primarily genetic and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. <h2>Understanding Norrie Disease Cause</h2> Norrie disease is a complex genetic disorder that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness. It is caused by a mutation in the NDP gene, which is responsible for producing the norrin protein. This protein is critical for the development and function of the retina, the part of the eye that detects light and sends signals to the brain. In individuals with Norrie disease, the mutation in the NDP gene prevents the production of norrin or leads to a non-functional protein. Without norrin, the retina does not develop properly and can become detached from the back of the eye. This can result in vision loss or complete blindness. The mutation in the NDP gene that causes Norrie disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that the gene mutation is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes.
