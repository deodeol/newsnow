The concept of WAR was developed as a way to measure a player's overall contribution to his team, taking into account both his offensive and defensive performance.</p><p>Over the years, WAR has become one of the most widely used and accepted statistics in baseball. It allows fans, analysts, and teams to compare players across different eras and positions, and it provides a more comprehensive view of a player's value than traditional statistics like batting average or home runs.</p><p>When it comes to mike trout career stats war, there is also a myth that surrounds his numbers.

While this does not diminish his individual performance, it does highlight the fact that WAR is not a perfect measure of a player's value.</p><p>Another factor that can impact a player's WAR is injuries.
